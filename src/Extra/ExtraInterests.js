            I have a huge passion for football and at the age of 16 was offered a football scholarship at FAB academy which resulted in being offered a semi-professional contract for Spanish side Alicante at the age of 18, I still currently play football as well as referee as much as I can! I also have a dachshund called Dash (original I know) and enjoy walking him in my spare time. When I'm not playing football, refereeing, or walking Dash, I'm busy continuing with my studies.
